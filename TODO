- new commands
	- initialize HFS/HFS+?
	- resize
		- ok to fail on wrapped HFS+
		- ok to fail on journal or bad blocks
		- ok to copy rather than resize in-situ
		- just relocate extents, don't implement full r/w btrees
		- i think we're too slow :(
	- copy files to HFS+?
- make us fast! probably requires rewrite :(
